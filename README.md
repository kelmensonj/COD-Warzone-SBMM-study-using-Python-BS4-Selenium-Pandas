# COD-Warzone-SBMM-study-using-Python-BS4-Selenium-Pandas
Still a work in progress, no documentation, code is simple - no classes, mostly for loops and lists - but the files are a mess. I used this code in order to scrape codtracker for data hundreds of thousands of players and matches in just a week using this ultrabook, and with limited modification I hope to reproduce XclusiveAce's study thoroughly as well as the 2017 EA study on SBMM in Apex.
********Also I apologize if anyone comes here and sees upwards of 10 files and nothing makes sense because there's no documentation. I'm going to be making a version 2.0 that will all be in one file and it will have comments/documentation throughout, and hopefully at least a tkinter interface. I'm just getting the files up here because this is the state all the scripts were in when I scraped the data and completed the study. So while technically these files are all useable and should net csv files containing data scraped from cod.tracker.gg, I would suggest mainly copying bits and pieces of my code in the meantime before I add an updated version. Thank you
